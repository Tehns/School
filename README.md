# School Work
This repo will be used for stuff I learn and do in school, school asignments, basically anything I make in school goes here. Maybe this helps someone in the future. But I just want to kind of document and share my progress in programming.

All projects are sorted by which language so it should be easy to navigate. I'm not the best at naming though. 

| Language | Projects |
|--|--|
| Ruby| <center>12</center> | 
| C# |<center>0</center> |
| C/C++ | <center>0</center> |
| Python | <center>0</center> |
